# javascript-toggle-menu

A nav bar menu button that, when clicked, expands a sidebar with more links to choose from. Created as a means of practising Javascript.

Based on the Youtube tutorial by "mmtuts". 

NOTE:

I noticed that the tutorial gives the anchor elements in the CSS (the links in the sidebar) an opacity value, and then creates a FOR loop in the JS to change the opacity value for each anchor element. This is fine, but I noticed that it seems simpler to just give the unordered list an opacity value, and then to just change that one value with the JS. This negates the need for a FOR loop but, visually, it produces the same outcome.
